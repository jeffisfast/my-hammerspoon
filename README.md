Trying to get my Mac's Stream Deck to automatically dim when the computer is idle or sleeping using Hammerspoon.  

Doesn't seem to work if the Elgato Stream Deck software is also running.  Just posting here in case it helps someone while I troubleshoot.

Thanks

Based on snippets I've found online from a few sources.
